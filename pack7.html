                <h4>Six (6) Days Gorillas and White-Water Rafting Safari</h4>
                <p>This combines gorilla trekking at Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park white water rafting experience on the
                   River Nile in Jinja, Uganda. Jinja is popularly known for being the source of the river Nile, the longest river 
                   on planet earth. 
                   <br>The Safari then takes you to Bwindi Impenetrable National Park where you will have a chance to trek one of
                    the habituated families of mountain gorilla. This trip can as well start from Bwindi and end in Jinja.

                <h4>Day 2: White Water Rafting, Kayaking, Bungee Jumping</h4>
                <h4>White Water Rafting</h4>
                <p>The main draw of Jinja is its heart-palpitation-inducing white water rafting. <br>
                  There are three different levels of rapids to choose from. Class three rapids are for intermediates, class five 
                  rapids for experts and adrenaline junkies, and class two rapids for families and beginners. <br>
                  Helmets, life jackets, safety training and photos of the experience will all be included as part of the tour pac
                  kage. <br>
                  There are no hippos in this part of the Nile and crocodiles are extremely unlikely (there has not been a crocodil
                  e related incident in 20 years of rafting). <br>
                </p>
                
                <h4>Kayaking</h4>
                <p>For white-water kayakers, the Nile is one of the best rivers in the world. <br>
                  If you have experience, but would benefit from a refresher, experienced guides and multi-day courses are available. 
                  River Surfing is also available for those willing to brave the cold waters. <br>                 
                  However, for beginners and families, a more sedate option is to kayak on the flat-water of Lake Bujagali. 
                  </p>

                  <h4>Lake Cruises and Birding Tours</h4>
                  <p>Lake Bujagali is also the venue for lunch and sunset cruises using two-storey cruisers similar to those on the K
                    azinga Channel in Queen Elizabeth National Park and the Nile at Murchison Falls. <br>
                    Full and half day birding cruises are offered by specialised operators, providing the chance to see the local bird
                    life from the water. <br>
                    Notable species include the martial eagle, white-backed night heron, rock pratincole, papyrus gonolek and crimson-rumped waxbill.                    
                    </p>

                    <h4>Bungee Jumping</h4>
                    <p>If you are looking for an extra thrill, then a 44 metre bungee jump is available for the brave or foolhardy at Adrift’s Nile
                       High Camp. <br> 
                      Bungee jumping can be done both at night and during the day, but most people do it in the day to fully appreciate the madness
                       of it all - plummeting down before dipping your fingers into the Nile as the elastic pulls you to safety.  <br> 
                      Adrift follow New Zealand safety standards, and per the guidelines regularly check that the equipment is safe to use.
                      </p>
                    
                    <h4>Day 3: Quad Biking, Horse riding, and Lake Cruises and Birding Tours</h4>
                    <h4>Quad Biking</h4>
                      <p>Quad biking takes adventure to a whole other level and does not require prior driving experience. A free 
                        training session is conducted before each safari and trips are tailored to suit the riders’ ability and gi
                        ve the best possible adventure of whitewater rafting in jinja. Sliding across the puddles and potholes in 
                        mud makes quad biking much more fun.</p>

                        <h4>Horse Riding</h4>
                        <p>Horse riding is done along the shores of River Nile and it is a great way to explore Uganda’s beauty. T
                          he surrounding landscape and the local communities make horse riding such a fun and adventurous experienc
                          e.Whitewater Rafting in Jinja also you can do some of birdwatcher also stand a chance of encountering ma
                          ny of the different bird species along the shores of River Nile. </p>
                        
                        <h4>Day 4: Transfer to Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park</h4>
                        <p>After breakfast, depart at 6:30 a.m. for Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park, passing through Kampa
                          la, Mbarara Town, which is blessed with stunning scenery. You'll also see some rolling hills with terrac
                          es; it's a beautiful drive with all of these sights. When you arrive at the park, check into the lodge o
                          f your choice and spend the rest of the evening relaxing before the next activity. Stay the night and e
                          at there.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Day 5: Gorilla tracking & Community Walk – Bwindi Forest</h4> 
                        <p>You will have your breakfast at 6:30 a.m., then proceed to the park headquarters with a packed lunch to 
                          receive a briefing from trained park rangers. At 8:00 a.m., park rangers will accompany you as you enter
                           the mist forest to trek mountain gorillas. If you are not physically fit enough, you may need to use a w
                           alking stick. You should also consider paying porters a small fee to carry your belongings just in case.
                            The trek can last between two and eight hours, but you only have one hour to see and interact with the
                             gorillas. Return to the resort to unwind after your hike. Later that evening, take a walk through a d
                             ifferent village, such as the Batwa community, to connect with the locals and learn a lot from them be
                             fore retiring to the lodge.</p> 
                        
                          <h4>Day 6: Departure</h4>
                          <p>After a delicious breakfast, you will depart for Kampala. Our driver will drop you off at your Kampala
                             accommodation facility or take you to Entebbe Airport. This will mark the end of your 6 days tour. <br><br></p>
