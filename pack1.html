                <h4>Three (3) Days Chimpanzee and Bigodi Uganda Safari</h4>
                <p>This trip to Kibale National Park will make you know that spending one hour with chimps is exciting, but wait un
                  til you spend a whole day with these Chimps while on a 3 Day Chimp Habituation. Kibale National Park is known as
                   the primate capital because of the huge number of chimpanzees and other primate species that live in the park.
                   <br>The 3 Day Chimp Habituation and or chimpanzee tracking safari is a great alternative to the 3-day goril
                  la trekking safari especially considering the cost.

                     fter a busy morning. This experience gives time to get into the lives of the chimpanzees and see their differe
                     nt ways throughout the day. It is also good for photography as you have time with the chimps. <br>

                     not have crowds which you may find in the ordinary chimpanzee tracking where several small groups of tourists
                      track different groups of chimps in the same habituated chimpanzee community and can sometimes crisscross ea
                      ch other during tracking.
