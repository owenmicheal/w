                <h4>Five (5) Days of Gorilla and Wildlife Safari </h4>
                <p>This trip will take you to Queen Elizabeth National Park for game drives and a boat cruise on the Kazinga channe
                  l, that connects Lake George and lake Edward. This Channel has the highest concentration of Hippos in the whole w
                  orld, with over 600 species of birds. On a ‘good’ day, a cruise along the Kazinga Channel can expose you to more
                   wildlife than you can find on any given game drive.
                   <br>You will then visit the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park where you will have a chance to trek one of
                    the habituated families of mountain gorillas.

                <p>Our company driver will meet you at your hotel in Entebbe or Kampala and drive you to Bwindi Impenetrable Nati
                  onal Park. This is a long drive of about 8 hours, with a lunch break along the way. Despite the long distance,

                   and the terraced hills of Kigezi, also known as the Switzerland of East Africa. You will arrival late in th

                <h4>Day 2: Gorilla trekking in Bwindi National Park</h4>
                <p>Morning: Given the physical demands of gorilla trekking, you will need a substantial breakfast before heading to
                   the Park Headquarters at 7:00 a.m. for a pre-tracking briefing. At 8:00 a.m., you will proceed to the jungles to
                    track the adorable mountain gorillas in their natural habitat, which is characterized by thick forest covered 
                    in mist. Trekking takes 2-6 hours, and once sighted, you will only have one hour with the assigned gorilla fam
                    ily to study their behavior and take photos before returning to the lodge to relax. <br>
                  After a rewarding trek through the jungle, we sit in the forest among the mountain gorillas, listening to them co
                  mmunicate with one another. Marvel at the sheer size of the dominant adult male gorillas, known as Silverbacks,
                   and have one of Africa's most moving wildlife encounters. After lunch in the forest, we take a well-deserved r
                   est or go bird watching. <br>
                  We return to our peaceful lodging to rest and recover from our unforgettable gorilla trek in Uganda's Bwindi Fo
                  rest. <br>
                  Afternoon: If you still have energy, you will undoubtedly continue on for a cultural walk to Batwa villages to 
                  immerse yourself in their ancient lifestyles and be entertained by their traditional dances. We then return to 
                  our lodging.
                  </p>

                  <h4>Day 3: Drive to Queen Elizabeth National Park</h4>
                  <p>After a delicious breakfast treat, drive to Queen Elizabeth National Park, which is blessed with a lot of
                     beauty, including lakes, forest, savannah grassland, and wetlands. We will enter the park through the Ishash
                     a sector, which is famous for its rare tree-climbing lions, and if we are lucky, we will see these rare spe
                     cies before continuing to the northern side of the park, where we will spend the night. Have a meal. </p>

                  </p>
                  
                  <h4>Day 4: Game drive and afternoon boat cruise on Kazinga Channel</h4>
                  <p>Morning: After an early morning breakfast, we head for a game drive through the Kasenyi Plains where you are likely to spot
                     the African tree climbing lions and the elusive leopards, Uganda kobs, Elephants, buffaloes, bushbucks, Defassa waterbucks and
                      warthogs in addition to at least 200 bird species. Lastly, after this amazing 2-3 hours’ activity, head back to the Lodge for
                       lunch and relaxation as you prepare to go for the boat cruise
                      <br> <br>

                      buffaloes and Uganda Kobs, as well as bird species like Kingfishers and shoebill storks, can be spotted.

                    Kampala with lunch en-route and thus the end of your five-day safari.
