                <h4>Queen Elizabeth National Park</h4>
                <p>Queen Elizabeth National Park was originally called Kazinga National Park established in 1952. It was given a 
                  new name in honor of a visit by Queen Elizabeth II of England two years later. It is one of Uganda’s oldest and 
                  most popular game parks for Uganda safaris. It is found in South Western Uganda bordering the Democratic Republic 
                  of Congo. The Park is home to variety of wildlife and boasts a range of attractions and interesting activities 
                  that make it truly gifted by nature. The road that runs through Queen Elizabeth National Park crosses latitude 00
                   at precise locations marked by monuments on either side of the route. 
                  
                  <br> <br>Our 3 Day Queen Elizabeth wildlife safari is specially designed for those that have less time in Uganda 
                  but would love to enjoy game drives, scenic views as well as boat cruise on Kazinga Channel. Queen Elizabeth 
                  National Park located in western Uganda is one of the few respected National Park when it comes to game viewing, 
                  boat cruises, Chimpanzee trekking in Chambura, nature walks among other activities. Our 3 Day Queen Elizabeth 
                  wildlife Safari starts and ends in Kampala but can also be organized starting from other small towns in Uganda.

                <h4>Game Drives</h4>
                <p>The major highlight of a visit to the park are the scenic game drives that give you a chance to view even the 
                  most elusive of the park’s fauna. The thrilling drives which are best done during the morning hours feature up 
                  close viewing of the wildlife which inhabits the park in the comfort of a vehicle. Your driver guide knows the 
                  different trucks in the park intimately and will take you in search of the different wildlife.
                  <br>During the game drives, you could spot an elephant, the largest land mammal skillfully using its trunk to 
                  feed, a lion preying on an antelope or a hyena patiently waiting to devour the lion’s leftovers from a distance.
                   Different groups of animals like Buffalo herds and Uganda kobs traverse the game park all day long. Warthogs, 
                   leopards, the giant forest hog are among the others you are very likely to meet on your game drive.
                </p>

                <h4>Bird Watching</h4>
                <p>Queen Elizabeth National Park is one of Uganda’s top birding spots. A haven to over 600 bird
                   species, the enthusiastic bird watcher is in for a major delight at the park.
                  <br>Some of the birds likely to grace your photographic memories include the; Sedge warbles, Papyrus canary,
                   the martial eagle, Pink backed Pelican, Yellow throated Cuckoo, and the Verreaux’s Eagle Owl, all which inhabit
                    the park’s expansive grasslands, forests and wetlands. Do not miss the flamingos found at the Katwe and
                     Bunyampaba salt lakes.
                </p>
                  
                <h4>Boat Trip/Launch Cruise</h4>
                <P>The boat trip/launch cruise which takes place on the Kazinga Channel, a long natural water channel linking Lake 
                  Edward to Lake George is an exhilarating event for the visitors at the park.
                <br>During the cruise, one gets to enjoy the various sights and sounds that the park’s rich aquatic life 
                extravagantly offers. Besides the large hippopotamuses taking their dips in the waters, the fierce Nile crocodiles 
                basking lazily on the channel banks for a feel of the warm sun are some of the lifetime experiences you will 
                encounter on the cruise. Not to miss are the Pied Kingfishers attempting to grab a meal.
              </P>

                   <H4>The Tree Climbing Lions of Ishasha</H4>
                   <p> Not every day do you see a lion climbing a tree, in fact it was considered a safe bet to climb one if you 
                    ever found yourself being chased by one. Not while in Ishasha sector though, a region comprising a portion of 
                    Queen Elizabeth National Park. Here, lions perched up on acacia and fig trees are an enchanting sight to behold.
                    Whether it is for a better view of their surroundings including potential prey like the Uganda Kob that grazes 
                    in the vicinities, seeking the cool breeze in the trees or escaping the notorious bites from the tsetse flies 
                    on the ground below, the reason for the lions choosing residence up the trees remains an intriguing mystery.
                    <br><br>The Ishasha sector where these lions are found is accessible on the journey to or from Bwindi 
                    Impenetrable Forest as one heads or returns from gorilla trekking in the forest. Besides the amazing tree 
                    climbing king of the jungle, the sector is also home to other animals such as herds of buffaloes, large numbers
                     of elephants, warthogs and antelopes all which make for a memorable trip to the game park.
                    </p>

                  <h4>Chimpanzee Trekking</h4>
                  <p>The Kyambura Gorge, also known as the Valley of Apes found in the Northern part of Queen Elizabeth National 
                    Park is home to chimpanzees. The chimpanzees in Kyambura are habituated meaning they have been accustomed to
                     human presence and this does not deter them from going on with their activities.
                    The underground rainforest in a gorge which makes for an excellent protection from the sunshine as one enjoys 
                    the immense beauty of nature hidden there in. You will experience lush savannah grasslands leading to the gorge
                    , to the flowing rivers and creeks. Red tailed monkeys, baboons, butterflies and different bird species are 
                    among other inhabitants of this little paradise worth sighting besides Chimpanzees.
                    <br><br>Besides the primates, the forest boasts great hiking trails upon which there is a lot to explore. 
                    While walking in the forest, look out for soldier ants as they have such a painful sting. Otherwise you are in 
                    for an exciting experience while trekking one of man’s closest primate relatives.
