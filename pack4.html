                    trative hub. Wildlife/animals parade themselves to the salt licks to savor the flavor of the salty licks crea
                    ted of water and soil. The western shore of Lake Mburo is the location of a second nature walk that begins at

                     s returning to their dens. A further fascinating walk takes you into the forest, revealing views of the birds
                      that it supports. Different exciting treks take you through woodlands, providing chances to see other mamma
                      ls, while hikes up a hill give you a perspective over the park's 9 sections rounded off with its 14 lakes
                      . After the walk, you will return to the lodge, freshen up and checkout then Depart for Kampala or Entebbe.
