                <h4>Rwenzori Mountains National Park</h4>
                <p>Rwenzori Mountains National Park is located in Southwestern Uganda within the Rwenzori mountains. The park has 
                  Margherita peak, which is Africa’s third highest, for which it is famous. 
                  
                  <br> <br>The Park also provides great opportunities to seeing nature at its finest. Its plant life diverges from 
                  dense tropical rain-forest, bamboo woodlands, montane cloud forests to high-altitude vegetation and the decor is 
                  correctly outstanding. Beyond 4,500 meters, the snow and glaciers complement that special element to the astonis
                  hing views throughout this unspoiled mountain range.
                  This park is mostly famous for mountaineering, trekking, hiking and climbing excursions or safaris with or 
                  without summiting the Margherita.

                <h4>Expectations</h4>
                <p>There are two types of hiking experiences in the Rwenzori’s: high altitude and low altitude. The low altitude treks won't take you beyond 4,000 meters and typically last 2-4 days. High altitude treks take you to the peaks above 4,000 meters, and last between 4-12 days. 
                  The Rwenzori’s can be visited as a standalone adventure, but they're often combined with other destinations along Uganda's south-west circuit, including Kibale National Park, Queens, and Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. 
                  <br><br>Accommodation is in basic wooden huts that have been constructed along the trails, each fitted with bunk beds and separate toilet huts. 
                  The Rwenzori’s are home to Uganda's highest point: Margherita Peak (5,109m) on Mount Stanley. If you want to summit Margherita Peak, you will need to spend a minimum of 7 days in the mountains.

                <h4>Day 1: The Adventure Begins!</h4>
                <p>We start the adventure walking up the valley and through the lush Afro Montane Forest Zone. This is a steady 
                  climb teeming with wildlife to look out for, including groups of Colobus and L'Hoest monkeys.
                  <br>Immerse yourself among the flora in the Bamboo-Mimulopsis Zone as you begin to navigate the much steeper 
                  climb that reaches Kalalama Camp (3,147 metres).  Now in the serene forest of the Heather-Rapanea Zone, keep an
                  eye out for the beautifully vibrant Rwenzori Turaco bird - a must-spot for avid birdwatchers!
                </p>

                <h4>Day 2: Kalalama Camp to Bugata Camp</h4>
                <p>Bypassing Mutinda Camp and continuing up to Bugata Camp (4,100 metres), the trail takes you through the grassy 
                  knolls of the ridge and down through the serene valley before climbing back up again. This route takes you over 
                  the trickling streams and close to the beautiful photo opportunity of moss-covered waterfalls.
                  <br><br>Step over boardwalks in the more boggy areas among the Heather trees and cross the Mutinda Valley - rich 
                  with flowers and Giant Lobelias - before the steep climb up to Namusangi Valley (3,840 metres). This vantage poin
                  t offers stunning views of the Mutinda Peaks and reaches up steadily to Bugata Camp (4,062 metres), situated high
                   up in Bamwanjara Pass overlooking Bugata Lake and Lake Kopello.
                  This camp also offers views of Weismann's Peak (often covered with snow) and the chance to spot the Red Forest
                   Duiker, a sub-species of antelope only found here in the Rwenzori Mountains.                 
                </p>
                  
                <h4>Day 3: Bugata Camp to Hunwick's Camp </h4>
                <P>Leaving Bugata Camp, pass along a ridge before ascending to Bamwanjarra Pass (4,450 metres). On a clear day,
                   there are excellent views of the three main peaks of the mountains.
                  The trail passes down through the valley,  around the edge of bogs and thick evergreen vegetation.
                  This is one of the best places in the Rwenzori Mountains to spot the Malicite Sunbird feeding on the
                   Lobelia flowers.
                <br>The trail navigates through some steep sections before a steady climb up and over a ridge to Hunwick's Camp,
                 situated on the top of a deep valley.  This spot boasts views of Mt. Stanley, Mt. Baker, Weismann's Peak and
                  McConnell’s Prong.
              </P>

                   <H4>Day 4: Hunwick's Camp to Margherita Camp</H4>
                   <p>From Hunwick's Camp, pass down and across the valley floor to Lake Kitendara, with stunning deep waters and
                     beautiful flora.
                    From here you'll climb up Scott Elliott's pass, then along the ridge to Margherita Camp (4,485 metres), 
                    situated between impressive rock formations that offer some shelter from the strong winds. This is the very 
                    spot where the Duke of Abruzzi camped when making his climb to Margherita Peak in 1906.                    
                    </p>

                  <h4>Day 5: Mt. Stanley</h4>
                  <p>Start the day off early by climbing Mt. Stanley at 2.30am to ensure the best weather conditions,
                     aiming to safely reach the peak by 10am. 
                    For those clients with less mountaineering experience we suggest that you stay on Stanley glacier and
                     climb up to a good vantage point on a rocky outcrop on the southern edge of Alexandra Peak to enjoy fantastic
                      views over Congo and the lower mountain ridges.
                    After ascending the peak (5,109 metres) you then pass directly back down to Hunwick's Camp at (3,874 metres).                    
                  </p>

                  <h4>Day 6: Hunwick's Camp to Kiharo Camp</h4>
                  <p>From Hunwick’s Camp, start the day by climbing up towards McConnell’s Prong where you get the best views of 
                    all three  peaks and Scott Elliott’s Pass before reaching Oliver’s Pass (4,505 metres). The trail then cuts bac
                    k below Weismann’s Peak to the confluence of the Nyamwamba River, which flows down through Kilembe and Kasese
                     to Lake George in Queen Elizabeth National Park. 
                     <br><br>If you wish to climb Weismann's Peak (4,620 metres) from Oliver's pass you have the chance to do so 
                     here. On a clear day, there are impressive views of the surrounding mountains that are not to be missed.
                     After crossing the confluence of the river, the trail leads down to Kiharo Camp, situated in a deep and 
                     serene valley with high cliffs and lush vegetation.                   
                  </p>

                  <h4>Day 7: Returning</h4>
                  <p>Take the trail downhill to the Nyamwamba Valley, taking in the beautiful and unique views of the wildlife.
                     The cascading waterfalls, deep valleys and rich forests are among the best the Rwenzori Mountains has to offer. 
                    A few kilometres from Kiharo Camp, the path turns off to pass along the river. In some areas you may get 
                    the chance to catch another glimpse of the Duiker quietly feeding in small clearings.
                    <br><br> Following a narrow ridge to bypass steep sections, meet the river again and rest a while beneath 
                    natural rock shelter. After crossing a small stream, climb up a gentle slope before coming back down to the 
                    river to avoid the impassable waterfalls. This section of forest at the end of the trail are magnificent and
                     full of life - overflowing with birds, primates, Duikers and Hyrax.
