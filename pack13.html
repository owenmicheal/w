                <h4>Day 1: Transfer to Kasese for overnight.</h4>
                <p>After breakfast, you will be picked up from either the Airport/Guest House to start your trip to Kasese. The dri
                  ve will take you around 8 hours. You will have a stop over in mubende for lunch and then proceed with your journ
                  ey to Kasese for overnight at a hotel in area as you prepare yourself for the next days trek.
                </p>

                 <h4>DAY 2: Transfer to Sine Camp</h4>
                <p>You will transfer to the footsteps of the mountain to start the Climb up from 1,450 to Sine Hut 2,680m where you
                   spend a night. This hike starts from the valley floor through tall forest trees of the Afro Montane Forest Zone
                    and continues with a steady climb with multitudes of birds and a chance of seeing blue monkeys scampering off 
                    through the forest. At times visitors may see troupes of 15 to 20 black and white Colobus monkeys as they swin
                    g through the treetops. There are rare sightings of the L’Hoest monkey, which are part of the Bukonzo cultural 
                    emblems and are protected by the virtue of the King or Omusinga or you may hear wild chimpanzee in the distance. 
                   <br><br>There is wide variety of plant species from forest trees to bamboos thickets, low shrubs, flowers, fung
                   i, and with many moss and lichen covered vines hanging from the tall trees creating an awesome appeal. Enock’s F
                   alls are just 200 meters from Sine Hut and offer a splendid opportunity to capture a great screensaver for your
                    memories. At Sine Camp 2,596 meters we have wooden huts set between tall forest trees on a narrow ridge where y
                    ou may sit and enjoy the beauty of the Afro Montane forest while you look down at a fantastic waterfall crashi
                    ng over the rocks far below.
                </p>

                    <h4>Day 3: Climb to Mutinda Camp</h4>
                <p>Trekking starts at 8.00am and almost immediately you enter the Bamboo-Mimulopsis Zone, which is steep climb with
                   many high steps. In the wet season the bamboo zone is rather muddy and slippery making the going slow. However 
                   the atmosphere and the forest is beautiful as you climb 551 meters altitude and a distance of 1.8km to Kalalama 
                   Camp at 3,147 meters which is in the Heather-Rapanea Zone where you can take a rest and a quick cup of tea or co
                   ffee before heading on to Mutinda Camp.
                   <br><br>The trail meanders up and over several small knolls along a ridge top then drops down the side of the va
                   lley before climbing again, and in doing so cross several small streams and pass close to moss covered waterfalls.
                </p>

                <h4>Day 4: Hike to Bugata Camp</h4>
                <p>Wake up for breakfast at 8:00am and embark on the trail to Bugata Camp is boggy particularly in the wet season but
                   with a little skill you can step from tussock to tussock to make the going easier. First you cross the Mutinda val
                   ley through the tussock grass and everlasting flowers interspersed with many Giant Lobelias before climbing a stee
                   p section up to the Namusangi Valley (3,840 meters), with sheer waterfalls and looking back you get fantastic views 
                   of Mutinda Peaks. The Namusangi Valley is wide, with many ups and downs as the trail climbs steadily to Bugata Camp 
                   at 4,100 meters.
                 </p>

                <h4>Day 5: Hike to Hunwik’s Camp</h4>
                <p>Trek to Hunwick’s Camp via Bamwanjarra Pass. As you leave Bugata Camp you pass up a ridge then drop down slight
                   before ascending to Bamwanjarra Pass at 4,450 meters where we have a hut should the weather turn bad. From the pa
                   ss on a clear day you get excellent views of the three main peaks. The trail passes down the valley and around t
                   he edge of some bogs and thick evergreen vegetation, moss. Giant groundsel and lobelia.
                  <br><br>Here is possibly the best place in all the Rwenzori to observe the Malachite Sunbird as it feeds on the many
                   lobelia flowers and a known breeding site. Farther on there is some steep sections before a steady climb up and over
                    a ridge to Hunwick’s Camp which is situated on the top of a deep valley and has good views of Mt Stanley, Mt Baker,
                     Weismanns Peak and McConnell’s Prong.
                </p>

                <h4>Day 6: Transfer to Kiharo Camp</h4>
                <p>From Hunwick’s we pass down and across the valley floor to Lake Kitendara which is very stunning with deep water
                   and beautiful vegetation. From here you climb up Scott Elliott’s pass then up the ridge to Margherita Camp 4,485
                    meters which is situated between some huge rocks and offering some shelter from the strong winds. This is the 
                    very spot where the Duke of Abruzzi camped when making his climb to Margherita Peak in 1906.
                </p>

                <h4>Day 7: Descend to Samalira Camp</h4>
                <p>Wake up at 2 am and catch an early breakfast before heading off to climb Mt Stanley at 2.30am. This is necessary
                   as the weather has changed a lot and often even during the dryer season the mountain is closed in with heavy cloud
                   s and snowfalls from 1 pm to 4pm and this happens within a short period of 10 to 15 minutes as the clouds rise up 
                   from the extensive Congo rainforests.
                  <br><br>For those clients with less mountaineering experience we suggest that you stay on Stanley glacier and climb
                   up to a good vantage point on a rocky outcrop on the southern edge of Alexandra Peak to enjoy fantastic views over 
                   Congo and the lower mountain ridges After ascending the peak at 5,109 meters you then pass directly down to Hunwick
                   ’s Camp at 3.874 meters.
                </p>

                <h4>Day 8: Descend to Base Camp</h4>
                <p>From Hunwick’s Camp we start the day by climbing up a ridge towards McConnell’s Prong where you get the best views
                  of all three peaks and Scott Elliott’s Pass before reaching Oliver’s Pass at 4,505 meters. The distance from Hunwick’s
                   Camp to the top of Olivers Pass is 3km the trail then cuts across below Weismann’s Peak to the confluence of the Nyamw
                   mba River, which flows down thought Kilembe and Kasese to Lake George in Queen Elisabeth National Park.<br><br>
                   After crossing the confluence the trail meanders down the valley to Kiharo Camp at which is situated in a deep va
                   lley with high cliffs and dense vegetation. On the way down the valley after each bog you will climb over a ridge of s
                   tones and earth which seems out of place but actually was pushed there by slow moving glaciers which eventually stopp
                   ed moving, melted and left a pile of rocks and debris in front of where the glacier once stood.
                </p>

                <h4>Day 9: Descend to Samalira Camp</h4>
                <p>After breakfast the guide will pick you from the hotel and drive back to Kampala at the hotel or drop off at the airport.
                 <br>
                <br>Additional accommodation can be arranged for extra cost. You’ll be dropped off at the airport (or hotel).
                </p>
