                  Elgon24 million years back. Covering a 50 X 80 kilometer area, Mt. Elgon is a 
                  among the best Uganda safari destinations, having the biggest surface area of all extinct Volcanoes on the planet although it is the  4th highest mountain in East Africa. 
                  Mount Elgon National Park is home to a plethora of wildlife. The lower slopes of Mount Elgon are inhabited by elephants, buffalo, and a variety of small antelope.
                  The dense montane forest contains primates such as the black-and-white colobus monkey and the blue monkey.
                  The park is also home to over 300 species of bird, including the Tacazze sunbird and the lammergeier.

                    in Mt Elgon National Park. Among those limited to just a few mountains in eastern Uganda are the Black-shouldered Kite and Tacazze 
                  Sunbird. Mount Elgon is also home to the endangered Lammergeyer which can be seen, soaring above the caldera and the Suam Gorge.</p>
                  
                <h4>Hikes</h4>

                   Africa and it is a huge volcano with the largest crater of the major peaks in Africa with the caldera being one 
                   of the world’s largest.</P>

                   <H4>Nature Walks</H4>
                   <p>Nature walks in Mount Elgon National Park are an exciting activity experienced via different trails; 
                    <li>Khauka Cave Trail</li>
                    <li>Bambo Trail</li></p>
                  <p>The bamboo trail to Kapkwai Cave passes through tropical and bamboo forest. Along the trail are many primates
                  , birds and rare trees such as Elgon teak and Elgon olive. The walk to the Chebonet Falls and the walk to the 
                  Kapkwai caves follow the ridge view trail.</p>

                  <h4>Cave Visits</h4>
                  <p>Mt. Elgon is penetrated by highly-unusual caves. These include the larger caves of Kitum, Ngwarisha, 
                    Chepnyalil, and Makingeny. It’s such an amazing stopover. Some other caves are small and link to Kenya however
                     they are too dark to give you a proper direction to get to the border of Kenya. <br><br></p>
